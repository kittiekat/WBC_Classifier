White Blood Cell Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks

White blood cells are a key component of the immune system, and their evaluation is a critical part of health assessment. The objective of our project was to implement a neural network for white blood cell classification capable of performing on par with the models encountered in related literature. AlexNet, VGG, ResNet, MobileNet and Xception models were trained on images of peripheral blood smears, with a fully-trained MobileNet model achieving an average 99.26% accuracy across two data sets. 

The archive includes the two original datasets used in the analysis, as well as augmented versions of these data sets (PBC Data and Rabin Data). The code files include the best performing models along with their saved parameters. Jupyter notebooks for all other models fit during this project are included in the Other Models subfolder. Due to the number of models and size of the files, parameters for these models are not included. Code used for image augmentation and a utilities file containing other functions commonly used during our study can be found within the main archive.
